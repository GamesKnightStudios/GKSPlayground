            <p>
                Music makes all the difference when it comes to a full gaming experience.<br>
                Today we are going to be making music for the GameBoy using a useful software named OpenMPT and a couple of conversion tools.<br>
                This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l93RP986Zo" target="_blank">GamingMonsters video</a>.<br>

            <h3 id="section-header">Setup OpenMPT</h3>
            <p>OpenMPT is a tool for writing music that is designed for MIDI manipulation. Along with a useful tool from AntonioND
                <a href="(https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player">gbt-player</a> this can be used to create the files needed to
                design GameBoy music for your game.<br>Unfortunately the latest version of gbt-player no longer supports gbdk but
                thankfully a working version of the required files can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/gingemonster/GamingMonstersGameBoySampleCode/tree/master/19_making_music">here</a>
                (Included in this projects source code in the &#39;gbp-player&#39; folder).<br>To make music that will be compatible with the
                GameBoy you need to use the template file that is provided in this projects source code (gbt-player/template.mod). This has
                samples that aproximate the sounds the gameboy can make so you can play back your music and estimate what it will
                sound like on the GameBoy.<br>Download OpenMPT and open the &#39;template.mod&#39; file. To make sure you don&#39;t
                overwrite and loose this file I recommend saving a copy for you to work on by going to File-&gt;Save as and choosing
                a location to save the file. Also you may want to name the song which you can do by clicking on the
                &#39;General&#39; tab and entering a name in the &#39;name&#39; box, but this can be done later.

            <h3 id="section-header">Writing music</h3>
            <p>The two OpenMPT features that we will be using are the Patterns and Sequences. A pattern is a 64 row table split into
                4 main channels were you place the notes of the track. A sequence is a collection of patterns, for example you could
                have 3 patterns and play them in the order 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3 or 2-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1.<br>The template file contains
                4 empty patterns in a 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3 sequence. The image below explains how the interface is layed out:
                <img src="labelledinterface.PNG" alt="Labelled OpenMPT interface">
                Notes can be added to the pattern by clicking in the pattern table and then using your computer keyboard as a
                musical keyboard. The top row of the keyboard from &#39;Q&#39; to &#39;]&#39; will write notes from C4 to B4. The
                next row from &#39;A&#39; to &#39;#&#39; will write notes from C5 to B5 and so on. Also these keys can be used to
                record music live by making sure the record indicator is on and then pressing play. As you play notes these will be
                added to the pattern. To remove a note, select it with the mouse and press the space bar.<br>To change the
                instrument you are writing with select it from the drop down list at the top. Make sure to only use the instrument
                in the correct channels otherwise it will not work on the GameBoy. For example, channel 4 should only use
                instruments from 16-&gt;32, these are labelled with a &#39;4&#39; in the instrument name.<br>Double click on a note
                to change it&#39;s data, this will bring up the following dialog:
                <img src="noteeditdialog.PNG" alt="OpenMPT note edit dialog">
                Change the note or instrument here and also adjust the effect for this note, most commonly you will want to adjust
                the volume.<br>To adjust the pattern sequence click and drag them along the sequence boxes. Right click to
                copy/delete patterns.

            <h3 id="section-header">Playback</h3>
            <p>Playback can be controlled either for the pattern you are writing or for the whole sequence:
                <img src="labelledplayback.PNG" alt="Labelled OpenMPT playback interface">
                A useful button to know about is the &#39;Stop hanging note&#39; button, this is needed as sometimes a note will
                continue to play even when the playback is stopped.

            <h3 id="section-header">GameBoy conversion</h3>
            <p>Once you have your song written the next step is to convert the &#39;.mod&#39; file that OpenMPT uses into the code
                which can be used to compile in your Game Boy game. The tools used for this is &#39;mod2gbt&#39; and is provided in
                the &#39;gbt-player&#39; folder of this projects source code.
                Use the following command in the terminal to convert the &#39;.mod&#39; file:
            </p>
            <pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">mod2gbt</span> <span class="hljs-selector-attr">[FILENAME]</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.mod</span> <span class="hljs-selector-attr">[SONGNAME]</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">-c</span> 2
            </code></pre>
            <p>Replace [FILENAME] with your &#39;.mod&#39; filename and [SONGNAME] with the name of the song e.g.:</p>
            <pre><code>mod2gbt <span class="hljs-keyword">sample</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">mod</span> sampleSong -c <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
            </code></pre>
            <p>This will create a output.c file with the music data stored in an array. To use this file your game needs to be
                compiled with the gbt_player files &#39;gbt_player.h&#39;, &#39;gbt_player.s&#39;, and &#39;gbt_player_bank1.s&#39;
                provided in this projects source code in the &#39;gbt-player&#39; folder. The &#39;.s&#39; files are assembly files which hold
                the code to be able to playback music. I won&#39;t go into detail here about compiling GameBoy files, but note that
                you will need to compile these into &#39;.obj&#39; files and then compile your game. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-j -DUSE_SFR_FOR_REG -c -o main<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> main<span class="hljs-selector-class">.c</span>
lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-j -DUSE_SFR_FOR_REG -c -o output<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> output<span class="hljs-selector-class">.c</span>
lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-j -DUSE_SFR_FOR_REG -c -o gbt_player<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> gbt_player<span class="hljs-selector-class">.s</span>
lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-j -DUSE_SFR_FOR_REG -c -o gbt_player_bank1<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> gbt_player_bank1<span class="hljs-selector-class">.s</span>

lcc -Wa-l -Wl-m -Wl-j -DUSE_SFR_FOR_REG -Wl-yt1 -Wl-yo4 -Wl-ya0 -o music<span class="hljs-selector-class">.gb</span> main<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> output<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> gbt_player<span class="hljs-selector-class">.o</span> gbt_player_bank1.o
